# Story
You got diabetes.  
The very same thing that caused the deaths of both your mom and your grandma. It's like a family curse. But you don't feel like dying just yet.  
You decided to take matters into your own hands and embarked on a journey of revenge to kill everything sweet and cure your diabetes.  
You ventured into the Food World — an alternate reality where everything you have ever eaten transformed into gruesome monsters. Using the power of salty weapons, you slayed every sweet monster you encountered.  
And now, you reached your final destination — the Labyrinth Castle, where the detestable Sweet Emperor resides.  
You have but a single goal ahead of you: Kill the Sweet Emperor and put an end to this farce.
